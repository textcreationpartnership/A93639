            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOw excellent and how innocent the art of <hi>Husbandry</hi> is, has been ≈øufficiently made out by the be≈øt of <hi>Authors; God</hi> him≈øelf, who cho≈øe out that employment for the be≈øt of the Creatures, <hi>Man,</hi> whom he placed in <hi>Eden,</hi> not only to <hi>enjoy,</hi> but to <hi>labour,</hi> without both which no place can be a <hi>Paradi≈øe.</hi> Perpetual <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> without bodily <hi>exerci≈øe</hi> breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but loathing and di≈øea≈øes; For which cau≈øe the actions of <hi>body</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> are called <hi>Recreations,</hi> as carrying on the grand de≈øign of <hi>God</hi> him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Nor can there be found in <hi>Nature</hi> a more ingenuous, nece≈ø≈øary, delightfull, or honourable <hi>employment,</hi> than <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture;</hi> a <hi>Calling</hi> born with us, and bred in us, affording matter for the mo≈øt

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115703:6"/>the advantage, and then it is in the increa≈øe. How many rare ≈øecrets are there now di≈øcovered, whereby the Publick is enriched, whereof our Fore-fathers never dreamed? and ≈øome doubtle≈øs are as yet concealed from us, being left to po≈øterity and the next age to find out.</p>
               <p>Becau≈øe among≈øt many others relating to Husbandry ≈øome are of more excellent u≈øe, I have here made a ≈øelect choyce of them, reporting nothing but what ob≈øervation and experience, to which my Genius hath been long addicted, have found certainly true.</p>
               <p>And fir≈øt I ≈øhall begin with the improvement of ground by Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
               <p>There is to be taken five hundred acres of ground within fifteen miles of <hi>London,</hi> for eight ≈øhillings the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, which being ≈øtored with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Rabbits <hi>per</hi> acre, highly bred, ≈øixteen of them being Breeders, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to direction, will in all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115703:6"/>probability afford either of them twelve Rabbits at three litters. I have known tho≈øe ≈øo bred, that one Rabbit hath brought at one litter ≈øometimes ten, and commonly eleven, and hath brought them up very well, and fat, and at a Lords ground I have known the like increa≈øe, be≈øides tho≈øe of my own whereof I have had ≈øufficient experience; admit ≈øixteen Rabbits bring either of them but ten at three litters, they come to one hundred and ≈øixty Rabbits, for the which after ≈øix weeks of age I know a Poulterer that giveth eight pence the Rabbit, and con≈øtantly untill <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and ≈øome Poulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers more after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> which may be ≈øold ≈øo then between one ≈øhilling and one ≈øhilling eight pence the Rabbit; admit them but at eight pence the Rabbit all the year, one hundred and ≈øixty Rabbits come to five pound, ≈øix ≈øhillings, and eight pence the acre, and I am
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115703:7"/>confident that in grounds not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them, they brought the la≈øt un≈øea≈øonable years before this, four, five, and ≈øeven at three litters. I have been ≈øufficiently re≈øolved in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign by the mo≈øt of the Warreners throughout <hi>England,</hi> though I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their judgement.</p>
               <p>In five hundred acres at five pound, ≈øix ≈øhillings, eight pence <hi>per</hi> acre, to be con≈øidered the herbage for ≈øheep and other cattel at lea≈øt one hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> be≈øides the keeping of Poultery, Phea≈øants, Partridge and other fowl, with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Bees, &amp;c. and places for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other plantations at twenty, thirty, forty, fifty pound an acre profit <hi>per annum</hi> and upward, with fi≈øh-ponds accordingly ≈øtored; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, there is an other profit in this de≈øign very con≈øiderable, and of no ≈ømall con≈øequence, with hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping compleat for all occa≈øions, and great conveniency for a Dairy, and very conveniently near <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115703:7"/>
               <p> Sum total, two thou≈øand, ≈øeven hundred, ≈øixty and ≈øix pound, rent for the ground, two hundred pound ≈øalaries ≈øixty, five pound food for the Rabbits, in Hutches one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, admit though more than needs by far, being there are now better preventions than formerly, one thou≈øand Rabbits at eight pence the Rabbit three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty three pounds, total ≈øix hundred ninety eight pounds, <hi>de claro</hi> two thou≈øand ≈øixty five pounds. If the number of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits be thought too high, and the ca≈øualties too low that followeth, to make up all, and to ob≈øtruct all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, the fir≈øt litter will breed the ≈øame year, being rightly bred and di≈øpo≈øed of, allow three of the la≈øt litters from every one of the fir≈øt breeders (the Buck being fir≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed) bring ten Rabbits, which come to one hundred and ≈øixty Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits <hi>per</hi> acre, and amount unto five pounds, ≈øix ≈øhillings, eight pence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115703:8"/>
                  <hi>per</hi> acre, total ≈øix hundred ≈øixty and ≈øix pounds as before.</p>
               <p>There are two Gentlemen now in <hi>London</hi> of great ability and repute, that will ju≈øtifie the≈øe proportions, and that they made out of two ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral five acres of ground either of them at lea≈øt ten pounds an acre <hi>per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is to be taken fifteen hundred acres, for one ≈øhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>per</hi> acre, that will after the like proportion, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of acres, bring many thou≈øand pounds more.</p>
               <p>That two thou≈øand acres may be had at the ≈øame rate, that will very near render the ≈øame emolument according to the number of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, the ≈øame I leave to con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

               <p>I have known five hundred Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders kept at a time in an hou≈øe, as may be within the 500 acres in Hutches, which would bring ≈øeven, eight, nine, or ten at a litter, but accounting only five at a litter one with another, being I formerly have de≈øtroyed the re≈øt, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated to two thou≈øand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                  <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Concerning Turnips.</head>
               <p>A Gentleman not far from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> having dealt for ≈øtore of ground, part whereof being a meer dry ≈øand, and over-grown with mo≈øs, that it was not worth two ≈øhillings the acre, I advi≈øed him to cau≈øe a cutting-Knife to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a new devi≈øed way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with with more conveniency than
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115703:14"/>formerly they pare up ≈øuch ≈øour ru≈øhy ground as they lately farm &amp;c. and call it <hi>Devon≈øhire</hi> Land and a Workman ≈øet about it he cut this ground ≈øome two inches thick, and turned it up, and layd the in≈øide outwards that done, letting the ground dry for the ≈øpace of a week, being formerly good neither for corn nor gra≈øs, the Workman with a ≈øtrong Iron rake raked the ground all over, then ca≈øt it over with Turnip-≈øeeds, and raked it over again, which came up ≈øo well, the leaves and roots did ≈øo well rot, cool, mellow, and meliorate the ground, that the year following and after the crop of Turnips there came very good gra≈øs.</p>
               <p>The ground being afterwards fit for corn or gra≈øs, part of which ground he again ≈øowed with Turnips the ≈øame year, and had two very great crops, and made at lea≈øt thirty pounds an acre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; be≈øides as I came to him he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115703:15"/>10 s. an acre for the leaves only being from the very tops of the bindings, when they are bound up in bundles, and for the other part of the bindings, he ≈øelling the Turnips by mea≈øure, made at the lea≈øt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhillings the acre, wherewith they now feed their milch Cattel, which they having plenty thereof will cau≈øe them to give milk three times a day with full ve≈ø≈øels, and con≈øtantly throughout the year, and better milk by far than any other, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the roots may be ≈øold in mo≈øt places as dear, as near <hi>London,</hi> and with the ≈øame benefit, yet the commodity of them is ≈øo exceeding great being known, they will not be parted with by any, for they are excellent for all ≈øorts of Cattel, and will feed them very fat in a ≈øhort time, and will likewi≈øe feed Calves and Lambs very fat, be≈øides, they being boyled will feed Swine to the height of fatne≈øs in a fortnights ≈øpace, and the liquor wherein they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115703:15"/>are boyled will feed them better than the be≈øt whey. And I have ≈øeen Cows exceedingly greedy for the liquor and the Turnips boyled, they have eat and drunk of them continually, and without any other food, have afforded Milk in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance more than with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther food what≈øoever, and became likewi≈øe fat therewith; the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips boyled will feed all ≈øorts of Poultty fat, and cau≈øe them to lay their egges con≈øtantly without any corn at all, whereby may be kept both Gee≈øe, Turkeys, Phea≈øants, Partridges, Coots, Moor-cocks, in abundance without any charge, ≈øo that 'tis clear Turnips will grow on the meane≈øt ground with little labor, &amp; without muck. I have known tho≈øe that have kept their hor≈øes fat by ≈øli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them &amp; ≈øo ca≈øting them into the Manger, and of all food what≈øoever there is nothing ≈øo whole≈øom and ≈øo healthfull as they be for Cattel, &amp;c. for thereby may be avoided the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115703:16"/>&amp; all other dangerous di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>There is a Knight row in this City that did pre≈øerve and keep all ≈øorts of Poultry (and Rabbits) by a pa≈øte as followeth, which was made of Bea≈øts liver, the cour≈øe≈øt la≈øt corn ground and bran, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent commixture: but I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly left out the Liver, and made a pa≈øte with the re≈øt compounded with Turnips: but I found in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion Turnips of them≈øelves is the only food both for Cattel, Swine, and Poultry. <hi>Probatum e≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Swine being kept in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard con≈øtantly bearing, the ground will fructifie the Fruit-trees exceedingly, and make them yield great ≈øtore of fruit yearly larger than formerly, and they need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther food than this Liquor, without the roots, or they may be kept up in a hou≈øe with it con≈øtantly.</p>
               <p>There was a Gentleman well known, that would cau≈øe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ≈øometimes to ≈øcatter on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115703:16"/>ground ≈øome ≈ømall ≈øtore of Tares, and the Swine by taking pains to get them would drink the oftner of the Liquor, and be fat the ≈øooner. I have known milch Cows kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly in a Yard, and never fed with any thing but Turnips, wherby a man might ≈øoon inrich him≈øelf, and having place convenient for Poultry, &amp;c. this may appear to be as thriving for them as corn.</p>
               <p>Turnips likewi≈øe boyled and mingled with bran will feed Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dogs very highly without any other relief. About ≈øeven years ≈øince I cau≈øed a woman here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to buy a peck of meal, and to divide it into two parts, in the one, I advi≈øed her to put a peny-worth of Turnips boyled, and work it and knead it by it ≈øelf, and the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels being baked, the Meal that had the Turuips in, that proved to be the better bread by far, and whiter, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way more plea≈øant to the eye, &amp; more tooth≈øom; it is in the judgement
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115703:17"/>of mo≈øt Phy≈øicians very healthfull; be≈øides, it cuts far better than the other, and will la≈øt as long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very moi≈øt, the parcel that had the Turnips in it was in weight above five pounds more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what advantage might redound hereby to publique and private families it may ea≈øily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult, when they may keep both Cattel, Swine, and Poultry, with little or no charge.</p>
               <p>There is as much difference al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt in the roots as is in Apples, therefore care is to be had in the ≈øeed; there are tho≈øe which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hackney</hi> Turnips, which far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all other, e≈øpecially for bread, &amp; that ≈øeed may be had as cheap as the other; a pa≈øte likewi≈øe might be made with turnips to continue long, which all Poultry would like very well of, and excellent Hor≈øe-bread might be made of it, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe u≈øed thereunto; all ≈øorts of Cattel and Poultry wil take ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115703:17"/>without further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the pa≈øte will be excellent u≈øefull food for Rabbits both in over-≈øtored Warrens, and likewi≈øe when they are pre≈øerved with other moi≈øt meats, as you may under≈øtand hereafter.</p>
               <p>Turnips will afford two very good crops in one year, and the crops of them are worth to be ≈øold thirty pounds an acre, as will be confirmed: be≈øides, ≈øome ground they will in my knowledge afford a 3d. crop the ≈øame year, &amp; although the roots of the la≈øt crop come not to full maturity, yet the roots and leaves being ≈øuffered to grow thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without cutting, or pulling, will be better at the pre≈øent than an acre of the be≈øt Gra≈øs, and compa≈øs of ground where a ≈øheaf of Wheat doth grow which yieldeth a ≈ømall quantity of wheat, it will afford one hundred of Turnips, near two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ≈øo that the profit of two crops thereof will far tran≈øcend the profit
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115703:18"/>of the wheat, and the charge of the wheat far greater ordinarily.</p>
               <p>Turnips may be ≈øown in heathy ground at the fir≈øt breaking up, and ≈øome have ≈øowed them immediatly after rye, flax, and e≈øpecially after pea≈øe.</p>
               <p>With their tops, and Rape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes or Lynt-≈øeed cakes, and grains you may make Pottage and whole≈øome food for your Cows, which being warm they will eat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedily, and by this means give milk in abundance, and for the ≈øame purpo≈øe the <hi>Holland</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants did lately buy up all the Rape-≈øeed here in <hi>England</hi> after the oyl was pre≈øt out, and made up into great Cakes, which hath been a very great commodity in <hi>Holland;</hi> The roots and leaves being made very clean and ≈øtamped together, then boyled in water, and then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Cows may make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Milk, and yet grow very fat, if they are kept up all the year.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115703:18"/>
               <p> A worthy Gentleman doth every year ≈øow a very large field with tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, according to my directions, and in the midde≈øt thereof he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth to be built a little ≈øleight ≈øhade or loppel with poles covered with ≈øtraw or ≈øome ≈øleight ≈øtuff on the top where he ties up his oxen, and other feeding Cattel, and giveth them the Turnips and the leaves cleanly wa≈øhed, and with them only ≈øeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Cattel very fat to the Markets, he continueth the ≈øame cour≈øe con≈øtantly every year, and pre≈øerveth all his gra≈øs for other u≈øes to his very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>Turnips al≈øo with ≈øome ≈ømall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will make very good Syder, and exceeding good Oyl hath been made thereof, which may be very advantagious and will prove no drug. <hi>Probatum est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may boyl Barly chaff in the Liquor of Turnips, together with the Turnips and their leaves,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115703:19"/>which makes it as feeding, and as fatning as any foood what≈øoever; Rabbits may be kept with Turnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread or pa≈øt of Turnips all the year, either in the fields or hou≈øe, and better than with Turnips them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, being a mo≈øt whole≈øom food for them, and the roots and leaves will feed and pre≈øerve ≈øheep to the highe≈øt condition, and the Calves which you ≈øhall breed up by hand with the≈øe Turnips, their leaves, with their Liquor, will be con≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fat, and will much exceed their breed in largene≈øs, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of Milk.

               <p>ONe Sir <hi>Richard We≈øton,</hi> hath a think between thirty and forty acres, about ten acres thereof he ≈øowed this year with Barly, which Barly being in cutting, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ≈øo great, adjudged worth ten pound an acre, he feared it might hinder the Clover-gra≈øs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notwith≈øtanding we viewing it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115703:32"/>by that means will run a very great length, and grow with greater roots by far than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe, in≈øomuch that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Servant hath ob≈øerved, for five acres of Liquori≈øh to make two hundred pound an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre; Be≈øides there was a crop of Onions growing upon the five a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of Liquori≈øh, for which there was offered twenty pound an acre; half thereof being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pick'd out and ≈øold for at lea≈øt twenty pound more, and this may be confirmed for a truth at any time, ≈øo that there is but one year of three void of profit; and ≈øome benefit may be made that year.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115703:67"/>would pray that it would plea≈øe God to ≈øend a ≈øhower of rain, and this Engin, with the ble≈ø≈øing of God, will at any time comply with their de≈øires, and make the earth ≈øo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that in my knowledge one acre ≈øo watered, I mean with the muck water, will render neer, if not fully twenty times more benefit, than any other acre, being tylled in the ≈øame manner, which will be (I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident) as great a benefit to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ever was devi≈øed, be≈øides I ≈øhall be able to help any man with an Engine for a ≈ømall matter that will be very u≈øefull to water grounds in this nature, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convenient and commodious for Gardens, which will likewi≈øe wa≈øh off <hi>Caterpillars</hi> from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and tho≈øe that grow again≈øt the Walls, and tho≈øe that will alter the leaves and fruit beyond belief, <hi>experience</hi> ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm as much unto you.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:115703:68"/>
                  <p> When your Corn is likewi≈øe ≈øteeped in the Liquor about ≈øome four and twenty hours, according to my after directions, you may expect a far greater fertility and profit, which hath been ≈øeen above one hundred for one in Corn.</p>
                  <p>When you have emptied your <hi>Pond,</hi> for the≈øe purpo≈øes, you are then before you fill it again to get out the mud, I mean the re≈øidence of the commixture, and to rake it out upon the bank ≈øide, which you may perform with the back of an old Armor; the≈øe, or one of them, being ≈øtrongly fixed upon a Poles end with <hi>Iron,</hi> the inward part of the Armour bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, will rake up all the mud by degrees, with much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and thereby you may clean≈øe any River or Moat, without divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water-cour≈øe going into the water, or let the water out of Moats, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:115703:68"/>
                  <p> I have known Rivers about <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> above forty years ≈øince, let a yard lower, be≈øides the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of drawing the Rivers, and the mudd ≈øo taken out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, called ≈ømall <hi>Codd</hi> was ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich, that they were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culou≈øly advantagious otherwi≈øe, which I ≈øhall hereafter di≈øcover.</p>
                  <p>When you have gotten out this mudd you are before to provide a convenient place for your Straw, muck from the Stables, and Cow-Hou≈øes, &amp;c. which mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in this manner, or other ≈øuch way according to the fancy of the Owner, <hi>viz.</hi> to incompa≈øs the place where you lay your muck with a Brick wall, about four foot high, only leaving a place for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, to fill out the muck in Carts, and by any means to cau≈øe the flooring to be ≈øtanch, not to ≈øoak, and drink in the water of the Muck-hill at all, but rather for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115703:69"/>prevention thereof, to make ≈øuch a pavement of Brick-≈øtone or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone if it may be had near, and the floor to be made with a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcent on both ≈øides to the middle, that the water may pa≈øs out in a Chanel into ≈øome wooden Ve≈ø≈øel, or Ce≈øtern that may ≈øtand in the Ground near, and ≈øo low, that the Muck-water may pa≈øs into it, which may be contrived ≈øo full of vertue and fertility, that the worth of it is of high e≈øteem, (being once truly experienced) will tran≈øcend exceedingly, and cannot be bought at too dear a rate.</p>
                  <p>There are many places where the Ground is ≈øo firm it needs not any other bottom, and the Liquor may be made by the meaner ≈øort in Ve≈ø≈øels, without a Pond, for ≈ømall parcels of ground, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the other charges might be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but I fir≈øt conceive it to be more proper to lay in the ≈øame quantity.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115703:69"/>
                  <p> Then by digging a pit to ca≈øt certain Loads of good Sand upon the Straw, and then loads of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Earth to concorporate with it, which if it were commixed at the fir≈øt it were better, but I leave the di≈øpo≈øing of that to knowing Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, to be ordered according to the condition of the ≈øoyls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain that any kind of earth that is moi≈øt digged out of pits without ≈øtones, may be ≈øo mingle as it may be excellent fruit full ≈øoyl, as Sand with Clay, Loam with Chalk, &amp;c. the one very much enriching the other, as gravel ground Dung'd with Chalk, and Chalk mingled with Gravel for want of Dung; but you may u≈øe if you plea≈øe only Sand, then the muck out of the Pond or Earth of Commons near the Ditch-≈øides, and Hedges, mud of ≈øtanding Pools, Sea-weeds, which are excellent ≈øoyl, ≈øhovelings of Streets, Yards, High-waies, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115703:70"/>leaves of Trees: as al≈øo Sea ≈øand, or any liquid bracki≈øh fatne≈øs, grea≈øie or oyly matter, tarry ≈øtuff, pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, the blood and offall of Bea≈øts, empty marrow-bones, the dre≈ø≈øing and remainder of Trotters of ≈øheep, which are mo≈øt excellent, the cuttings or ≈øhavings of Horns, hair, which is be≈øt to lay them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground before the Corn is ≈øown; then fuffer the Swine to mu≈øle it up and down.</p>
                  <p>Pilchers after the oyl is taken from them, the garbage of ≈øtinking Sprats, or the be≈øt of them when they are plentifull and cheap, they being cryed ≈øometimes for a peny a peck about the Streets in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon your mudd lay more ≈øtraw, then more loads of Sand, &amp;c. and as your judgement ≈øhall direct you, ≈øome Lyme properly di≈øpo≈øed, and ≈øome fat Chalk or Marl in equal wreathes, you may likewi≈øe ca≈øt it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115703:70"/>over in the right place with ≈øome Bay ≈øalt, and ≈øometimes when the Straw is uppermo≈øt, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe you may ≈øpare ≈øome of your Pond water, and ≈øcatter on all the ma≈øs that will occa≈øion the other to concorporate the better; and afford more, and richer Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.</p>
                  <p>By this means, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different charge, you may have manure ≈øufficient to ≈øerve all your Land, and ≈øuch, that one load be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly ordered ≈øhall maintain it as well as ≈øome ten loads of your common ≈øort of muck, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that comes from it will be ≈øo rich for the ≈øteeping of your ≈øeed, that the di≈øcour≈øe thereof till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented would be incredible.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman did lately a≈ø≈øure me, that the brine of powdering Tubs did afford him as good a crop of Corn, as ever was ≈øeen grow; urine of Mankind is of very great

                  <p>You may ≈øometimes ca≈øt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that drayneth from the Muck, upon the muck heaps again, which will afford the more vegetative ≈øalt, and de≈øend to the former receptacle more fructiferou≈øly, upon which ma≈øs and heap of muck, I mu≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance the nece≈ø≈øary and mo≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial way of a covering or ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which I will not in≈øi≈øt upon, but leave the re≈øult thereof, to the con≈øideration of profounder Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, only thus much I de≈øire to impart to the apprehen≈øions of others, that the ≈øalt muck heaps being expo≈øed in Winter, to the con≈øtant ≈øhowers of rain, do lo≈øe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115703:71"/>much of their ≈øtrength, the uppe part thereof being hardly worth the carriage, and ≈øpreading upon the ground.</p>
                  <p>There are ordinary muck places that have very ≈øtanch bottoms, and will contain the water without any farther charge, although the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodne≈øs of the liquor in a ≈øhort time make re≈øtitution to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail all expences.</p>
                  <p>And farther, concerning the ≈øteeping of Corn to manife≈øt the benefit of muck water. In the heat of Summer, when the Sun hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled a great part of the coloured water from their moats and Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill-pools, and that it groweth thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh and far, then re≈øerve a good pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thereof well bottomed with Clay, that will hold water, and in ≈øeed time ≈øteep your ≈øeed in it, but put the far water to it by little and little, as it drinkerh it up, that at the la≈øt it may be almo≈øt dry, ≈øift a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115703:72"/>≈ømall quantity of Lime among≈øt it, that ≈øo it may grow dry with the Lyme, then with this ≈øeed ≈øow or ≈øet your mo≈øt remote grounds from your dunghill, and by this means you will ≈øave ten times as much labour in carriage of the Dung.</p>
                  <p>Hereby excellent crops have been obtained beyond expectation, and not ≈øubject, being new ≈øowen, to be devoured with Fowls.</p>
                  <p>I have ≈øometimes occa≈øioned the ≈øplitting of the Corn, as they u≈øe to do for malt, and then have ≈øowen it, and it came up ≈øpeedily, and got the predomination of the weeds at fir≈øt, and ≈øo kept the ≈øame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it became of better encrea≈øe than ordinary, and it hath been ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently experimented, that when a dry ≈øea≈øon came upon ≈øowing, that the Corn thus ordered took root far better than other mens.</p>
                  <p>It hath been an antient Cu≈øtom to ≈øteep. <hi>Beans</hi> in ≈øalt water, being

                  <p>If you put Pigeons dung into the water, and let it ≈øteep all night, it will be as it were half a dunging.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Platt</hi> doth highly commend the often macerating and drying of Corn, and it is an excellent way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ob≈øervation to ≈øteep Corn.</p>
                  <p>If you cover the ground in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you mean to break up at the Spring with good ≈øtore of Fearn, it is and hath been a long time ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally commended, that it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ≈øuppre≈ø≈øeth the weeds for ≈øpringing up in Winter, which would much confound part of the heart of the Ground, and doth al≈øo much fructifie the Ground for all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115703:73"/>mannes of Roots and herbs, and very good to ≈øpread about the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Hop-yards, to keep the Ground warm, and to de≈øtroy the weeds and gra≈øs that would prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the fertility of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Some will burn to A≈øhes, Roots, and Stubble, the ≈øword and ≈øwarth of the Ground together with Fearn, ≈øtraw, ≈øtubble, thi≈øtles, heath, ≈øedge, ru≈øhes, furs, bean ≈øtalks, which do very much advance barren Grounds, and make them mo≈øt fructiferous.</p>
                  <p>Wood mingled with Clods, and ≈øuperfluous earth, and ≈øo burnt, and the A≈øhes added to ≈øome ≈øorts of Clay may be u≈øed with no le≈øs advantage than Marl.</p>
                  <p>And to manife≈øt the benefit of ≈øteeping Wheat, &amp;c. it may be performed with le≈øs plowing, and without muck, being provided with a convenient Ve≈ø≈øel of Wood, mingle water, Dung, and Corn together, which mu≈øt be ≈øtirred very well ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
